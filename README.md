java-cardiag
============

Description
-----------
Car diagnostic software for vehicles with OBD2 compatible interface.

Targets
-------
- support for most of today's operating systems
- communication via USB ELM327/OBD2 car interface, probably other in future
- stability
- simple startup, no system modifications needed (only JRE6 and higher)
- pretty maintainable code covered by tests, both unit (without real serial interface)
  and integration (with interface and car)
- open source free code

Problems
---------
- how
- only available hardware for testing - ELM327 clone (1.5a)
- only few available cars for testing - Lada Kalina 1.6 8V 2007, Å koda Fabia 2010, Ford Focus 2007.
- need help with a selection of the license ... GNU GPL v3? EPL? BSD?

Current stage
-------------
 - begining development.
